# Security Analysis Sample

## Analysis Summary
- **File**: auth_service.js
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Lines of Code**: 138
- **Analysis Type**: Security
- **Security Issues Found**: 4
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Analysis Date**: 2025-03-29

## Security Issues

1. **CRITICAL - Line 42-45**: Hard-coded credentials found in source code. Authentication secrets should never be stored in code.
   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = "8a4c1e6f7b2d3a9e";
   const API_SECRET = "s3cr3tP@ssw0rd123!";
   ```
   
   Recommended fix:
   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
   const API_SECRET = process.env.API_SECRET;
   ```

2. **HIGH - Line 67-72**: SQL Injection vulnerability in query construction. User input is directly concatenated into SQL string.
   ```javascript
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
   ```
   
   Recommended fix:
   ```javascript
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?`;
   const results = await db.query(query, [username, password]);
   ```

3. **MEDIUM - Line 95-103**: Weak password hashing algorithm (MD5) is used. MD5 is considered insecure for password storage.
   ```javascript
   const hashedPassword = crypto.createHash('md5').update(password).digest('hex');
   ```
   
   Recommended fix:
   ```javascript
   const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
   const saltRounds = 10;
   const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
   ```

4. **LOW - Line 124-132**: JWT token is created without expiration time, which can lead to indefinite authentication sessions.
   ```javascript
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id, role: user.role }, JWT_SECRET);
   ```
   
   Recommended fix:
   ```javascript
   const token = jwt.sign(
     { userId: user.id, role: user.role },
     JWT_SECRET,
     { expiresIn: '24h' }
   );
   ```

## Security Risk Assessment

This code contains several significant security vulnerabilities that should be addressed immediately. The most critical issues are:

1. Hardcoded credentials which could lead to unauthorized access if the codebase is exposed
2. SQL injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to access or modify sensitive database information
3. Weak password hashing that could make user accounts vulnerable to brute force attacks

## Recommendations

1. Move all secrets and credentials to environment variables or a secure secrets management service
2. Use parameterized queries for all database operations
3. Update password hashing to use a modern algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2
4. Add proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms
5. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
6. Consider adding additional security headers to HTTP responses
7. Add input validation for all user-provided data
